Static site generators are sort of a compromise between static web pages and a CMS in the sense that the SSG takes source source files and transforms them into static HTML pages. It has become a bit of a _buzzword_ lately for several reasons: 

**1. speed**

**2. security**

**3. version control**

For this website I used **Jekyll**. Having delved in Wordpress (a _CMS_) before, I was rather intrigued to try out Jekyll. While, all the above reasons make it sound like it is a walk in the park to set up a web page, I encountered a quite a few issues along the way. Most of the problems stemmed from the comparably little information on how to customise a theme. Once I figured out the folder structure and had found some helpful tutorials on YouTube (this in particular was incredibly useful) it was relatively easy to get a site up and running quicky, much thanks to Github pages. All in all, once I understood how to use Jekyll it was indeed an enjoyable experience.
