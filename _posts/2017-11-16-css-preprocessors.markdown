Preprocessed CSS is a way of using a scripting scripting language which is then compiled into CSS. By using preprocessed CSS one can add extra features to the styling process. For this particular website I used **_SASS_**. SASS is an extension of CSS3, meaning that CSS syntax is valid in a SASS document. 

One of the most useful features that I used quite a lot while styling this website was the use of _variables_. It is quite handy to be able to give memorable names to colours and fonts etc. I did find myself struggling to implement other SASS features such as _nesting_ and _mixins_ just because I've grown used to working with plain CSS, but I definitely plan on learning more about SASS for future projects. 

Pros and cons?
- adds another layer of complexity.
- it takes time to learn.


However, 
- adds new functionality and useful features (variables, nesting, )
- makes writing CSS less repetitive and makes it more organised.
- it will save time in the long run.
