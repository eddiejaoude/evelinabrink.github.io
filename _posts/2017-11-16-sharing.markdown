In order to allow a user interaction on my blog posts I used Disqus, a popular comment plug-in. Disqus was fairly straight-forward to set up, and only required some extra extra lines of javascript in the post.html section of my _layouts folder. All the code and information was provided by Disqus itself, so it was merely a matter of copy-paste. 

In order to implement sharing via social media I used Open Graph, which is protocol initiated by Facebook. I used mainly basic metadata such as url and name. I also added a an excerpt variable with a one-sentence description in the YAML part of every blog-post.
