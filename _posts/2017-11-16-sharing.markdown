In order to allow a comment system on my blog posts I used Disqus, a popular comment plug-in. Disqus was fairly straight-forward to set up, and only required some extra extra lines of javascript in the post.html section of my _layouts folder. All the code and information was provided by Disqus itself, so it was merely a matter of copy-paste. 

In order to implement sharing via social media I used Open Graph, which is protocol initiated by Facebook.
