## **Robots.txt**

Robots.txt is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers. It specifies where a web crawler such as a search engine is allowed to crawl and which pages it should ignore. It is, as such, highly important for search engine optimisation. 

On this particular site, I chose to leave the settings very general, as there isn't really any sensitive information or admin pages that should be ignored. The only user-agent which is allowed to index my web site is Google. 

## **Humans.txt**

Humans.txt is a text file which contains information about the people behind a website. In my case I chose to include author, last update and language used on the site.
