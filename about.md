<blockquote>I am currently studying web development (webbprogrammerare) at Linneaus University. Before I ventured into the land of coding, I studied Politics at the University of Glasgow, UK.

In my spare time I enjoy travelling (to escape the Scottish weather) and netflix binge-watching (also to escape the Scottish weather). </blockquote>
